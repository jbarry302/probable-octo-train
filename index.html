          <h2>Intramuros and Fort Santiago, Manila</h2>
          <p>
            Take a stroll through history lane within the walled city of
            Intramuros in Manila, one of the top landmarks in the Philippines.
            This 64-hectare Spanish fortress was erected by Miguel Lopez de
            Legazpi and was destroyed by the end of World War II. However, the
            ruins remain very alive today and are some of the top Instagrammable
            places in Manila. The area can be explored via Intramuros tours or a
            Manila bike tour. The area has become home to several universities
            and establishments. Here, you can find centuries-old churches which
            are architectural landmarks in the Philippines, and historical
            places in Manila like the grand Manila Cathedral and San Agustin
            Church, the oldest church in the Philippines, making the area a
            great place for a Philippines staycation.

          <h2>Kawasan Falls, Cebu</h2>
          <p>
            If you like jumping into or swimming in cool cascading waters,
            Kawasan Falls in Cebu hits the sweet spot. It is a multi-layered
            waterfall in the town of Badian and is best known for its turquoise
            waters. With a height of 40 meters, the first cascade, or level, is
            where most visitors stay, swim, and enjoy a natural water massage on
            board a bamboo raft. A 10-minute trek takes you up to the quieter
            second cascade.

          <h2>Kayangan Lake, Coron, Palawan</h2>
          <p>
            Kayangan Lake tours will take you to the jagged limestone cliffs and
            islets surrounding the lake. All these add up to a dramatic
            landscape, best seen from a 10-minute climb up a hill. Curiously,
            this view is not of the actual Kayangan Lake but the area where the
            tour boats park, but it is still breathtaking nonetheless. As
            spectacular as the views are above ground, the real gem is hidden
            underneath the lake’s glass-like waters. Rock formations and schools
            of fish abound, making the area a favorite snorkeling and
            free-diving spot for visitors and one of the most popular Coron
            Palawan tourist spots.

          <h2>Rizal Park, Manila</h2>
          <p>
            This 60-hectare urban park is where you will see the Rizal Monument,
            marking the execution site of the country’s national hero, Dr. Jose
            Rizal. Manila Bay’s breeze keeps the Philippine flag waving from a
            46-meter flagpole fronting his monument. The park also features
            manicured gardens, ponds, and a wide water fountain that lights up
            and dances to Filipino tunes by sunset. The park area is also home
            to a network of National Museums that you can visit.

          <h2>Tubbataha Reef, Palawan</h2>
          <p>
            Tubbataha Reef is regarded as one of the top diving spots in the
            Philippines, and perhaps, the world. Located at the heart of the
            Sulu Sea, it is considered a center of marine biodiversity and a
            haven not just for divers but marine conservationists as well. The
            only way to get to this marine sanctuary is through a liveaboard
            vessel from Puerto Princesa, Palawan. The access may be challenging,
            but it is probably what is keeping the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park
            teeming with some of the most unique underwater life in the world.
            It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was nominated as
            part of the “New Seven Wonders of the Natural World.”

            Travel back in time as you stroll along the streets of Calle
            Crisologo in Vigan as part of your Ilocos itinerary. This
            16th-century town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular
            tourist spot in the Philippines, quietly boasts old-world charm and
            Spanish colonial architecture and is the top attraction in Vigan,
            Ilocos tours and one of the top historical landmarks in the
            Philippines. The town famous for its Calle Crisologo tour has
            successfully managed to preserve the historic district where you can
            still find calesas (horse-drawn carriages). Sample the famous and
            delicious Ilocos empanada, and walk along cobbled streets lined up
            with souvenir shops selling pottery and Abel Iloko weaves, among the
            many things to see and do when in Vigan.
